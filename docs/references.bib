  abstractnote = {Several effects of a baroclinic current on inertial‐internal waves at constant frequency are investigated, primarily through use of the method of characteristics. The special case of waves propagating transverse to a baroclinic current is considered. When the slope of an isopycnal is of the same order of magnitude as the slope of the characteristics, appreciable asymmetries are induced in the characteristics, the phase and group velocities, and the solution itself. These asymmetric effects are especially significant for waves at the low frequency end of the passband for free waves. Also, modifications occur to the passband, resulting in anomalously high and low frequency bands. The effective local inertial frequency, σf = [f(f+vx )]1/2, separates the normal and anomalously low frequency bands. Hence, the low frequency limit of the normal frequency band increases or decreases depending upon whether the horizontal shear in the mean flow is cyclonic or anticyclonic. In the anomalous frequency bands, the slopes of both characteristics have the same sign, causing various refraction and reflection phenomena. If the absolute value of the slope, s, of an isopycnal exceeds its critical value, sc = effective local inertial frequency/Väisälä‐Brunt frequency, the anomalously low frequency band extends to imaginary frequencies. If s ? 0, the reflection of waves from a boundary is modified, the effective wavelength is increased, and the lines of constant phase are tilted from the vertical. For the general solution, discontinuities in the first‐order partial derivatives of the velocity field occur across certain characteristics. The nonseparable normal modes do not exhibit these discontinuous derivatives, but they only satisfy one of the two pairs of kinematic boundary conditions in rectangular regions.},

  abstractnote = {Evidence is obtained from the examination of synoptic charts to show that the horizontal components of the air movement in the vicinity of active fronts are such as to tend to increase the thermal gradient between the two air masses. The dynamical consequences of this type of frontogenetic flow are examined by numerical calculation in respect of a very simple atmosphere structure. It is shown that the characteristic upward motion of the warm air and sinking of the cold air must take place, but the calculated upward motion of the warm air is insufficient to account for the observed rainfall unless the effect on the temperature field of the release of latent heat in the cloudy air is taken into account. The characteristic slope of frontal surfaces also appears to arise from the vertical circulation which also tends to give the strongest horizontal temperature gradient near the ground and in the upper troposphere.},

  abstractnote = {We investigate the existence of two-stage and three-stage R-stable, P-stable, RL-stable, and dispersively enhanced diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta Nyström methods of orders three and four. We first show that a one-parameter family of two-stage third-order R-stable diagonally implicit methods exists, and that their dispersive order is at most four. From this we show that two-stage fourth-order R-stable, and third-order P-stable and RL-stable diagonally implicit methods do not exist. Next we show a two-parameter family of three-stage fourth-order R-stable diagonally implicit methods exists with dispersive order at most four, and that this family contains a one-parameter family of P-stable methods and a unique RL-stable. We also show that a one-parameter family of fourth-order diagonally implicit methods with dispersive order at least six exists, and that they are not R-stable. We present third- and fourth-order R-stable and P-stable methods with small principal truncation coefficients and discuss how these methods might be implemented in an efficient integrator.},
